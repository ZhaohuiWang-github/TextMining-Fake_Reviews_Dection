# TextMining-Fake_Reviews_Dection
Text Mining project:

+ Processed more than 9,000 lines of Yelp review data via Python and LightSide, and then constructed 9 behavior features plus 10 textual features to build models for fake reviews detection.  
+ Compared machine learning models built with Logistic Regression classifier, K-Nearest Neighbor classifier, Support Vector classifier, Decision Tree classifier, and Random Forest classifier.  
+ Employed F1-score and Confusion Matrix to evaluate the performance, and visualized results using PR curve and ROC curve, achieving 89.27% accuracy on the test set.
